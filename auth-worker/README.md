# OTYA Auth — Cloudflare Worker

Authentication service for **OTYA**. It powers registration, login, Google sign-in, email verification, password recovery, optional phone verification, linked identities, JWT issuance, consent and account security.

## Architecture

OTYA Auth owns identity and security. It does not own the user's local music, video or file library.

- Local OTYA playback must work without signing in.
- Local media scanning must not depend on the auth service.
- Account features can use the stable OTYA `user_id` from the JWT `sub` claim.
- Backup, sync and connected features may require an account.
- Phone numbers and recovery details are optional account-security information.
- The auth design stays reusable internally, but the public product is simply OTYA.

## Setup

### Core resources

Create/bind the existing production D1 database and AUTH_KV namespace, then apply `schema.sql` for a new environment. Production deployments use the IDs in `wrangler.toml`.

### Required secrets

```sh
wrangler secret put AUTH_JWT_SECRET
wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY
```

Google identity uses the configured `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` variable. Sensitive values must remain server-side.

### Optional Telegram account verification

OTYA supports two Telegram verification paths:

1. **Telegram Login / OIDC** — a signed-in user can link a Telegram identity.
2. **Telegram Gateway** — an optional code fallback for phone verification.

Configure the callback:

```text
https://petersmartlink.com/auth/telegram/callback
```

Optional secrets:

```sh
wrangler secret put TELEGRAM_LOGIN_CLIENT_ID
wrangler secret put TELEGRAM_LOGIN_CLIENT_SECRET
wrangler secret put TELEGRAM_GATEWAY_TOKEN
```

Never put Telegram client secrets or Gateway tokens in Flutter or browser code.

## Email provider

OTYA uses **Resend** for verification, password reset, welcome and security email.

All endpoints return `{ error: string }` on failure.

## Account information

Signup stays small: email, authentication credential, optional name and legal consent. Users can later add profile photo, verified phone, recovery email, country/region, locale and timezone.

Do not collect date of birth, gender, physical address, national ID/passport data or precise location unless OTYA has a clear future need and matching privacy controls.

## Token and OTP contract

- **Access token:** HS256 JWT, 15-minute TTL. Payload: `{ sub, email, iat, exp }`.
- **Refresh token:** random token stored in KV with a 30-day TTL.
- **Email verification/password-reset OTP:** exactly **5 characters** matching `^[A-Z][0-9]{4}$`.
- OTPs are single-use and rate-limited.

## Branding

The public product is **OTYA**. The account is a supporting part of OTYA, not a separate product. PeterSmart Link remains the legal/business/developer identity where needed.
