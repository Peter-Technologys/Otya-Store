# OTYA v1 Product Governance

Status: canonical v1 product rulebook

This document prevents OTYA from growing as disconnected features. Product, web, Android, Next, support, documentation and infrastructure must follow the same information architecture and naming rules. The broader PeterSmart Link organization hierarchy is defined in `PETERSMART_LINK_PLATFORM.md`.

## Canonical product names

- Developer / publisher: **PeterSmart Link**
- Product family: **OTYA**
- Android product: **Otya Player**
- AI assistant: **Next** / **Next by OTYA** where a fuller label is useful
- User identity: **OTYA Account**
- Signed-in environment: **OTYA Space**
- Privileged role: **Admin** / **Owner** according to the permission being described
- Android navigation: **Video / Music / Me**

Legacy names such as OtyaPlayer, Played, WOP, Ask OTYA, Message Otya, OTYA AI, otya-store and otya-ai must not appear in new customer-facing copy. Internal legacy identifiers may remain only where removal would break compatibility and must have an explicit migration path.

## Product-quality acceptance levels

A feature is not "done" because code exists.

1. **Implemented** — source exists.
2. **Functionally verified** — the real action succeeds.
3. **Product-quality verified** — fast, understandable, accessible, responsive, polished, with loading/empty/error/recovery states.
4. **Release verified** — production backend + physical Android device + security/configuration + end-to-end flow pass.

Only level 4 counts toward OTYA 1.0 release readiness.

## Information classification

Every new data field, page, API and integration must be classified before release.

### Public

Safe for everyone: company/product information, download information, public help, public Docs, status, privacy, terms, security contact, changelog and intentionally public catalog content.

### User-private

Visible only to the authenticated user: account data, private media metadata, personal playlists/history where synced, Next conversations where stored, backups and Space content.

### Staff

Support/operations information required for authorized work. Never expose through public pages.

### Admin

Release approval, user/account administration, incident controls, operational metrics and owner tools. Server-enforced authorization is mandatory. The Admin UI may appear inside Space only for an account the server identifies as eligible.

### Engineering-private

Worker topology, database schema, queue topology, deployment/rollback, internal APIs, incident playbooks and architecture details.

### Secret

API keys, tokens, JWT secrets, private keys, service-account credentials and encryption keys. Secret-store only; never documentation or client code.

## Public surface rules

The public product must stay simpler than the internal system.

### petersmartlink.com

Primary **PeterSmart Link organization** surface. It must answer: who PeterSmart Link is, what products exist, where OTYA belongs, how to get support, where documentation/status live and how to enter the signed-in environment. Otya Player marketing belongs on its product route rather than making the company homepage look like a single-app landing page.

### docs.petersmartlink.com

Public product documentation. Do not expose Worker names, database IDs, queue names, secrets, internal monitoring thresholds, release internals, raw logs or private architecture.

### status.petersmartlink.com

Operational truth only: service state, incidents and incident history. No marketing copy and no stack traces.

### space.petersmartlink.com

OTYA Account/Space entry point. Signed-out users get the single Otya sign-in journey. Signed-in users get their own Space. Account, security, connected providers, devices, settings, Next, Telegram and role-authorized Admin entry points belong in this environment.

Admin is not a separate account system. The server resolves the signed-in Otya identity to roles/permissions. Required owner verification happens as an additional factor in the same sign-in journey or as fresh step-up verification for a sensitive operation.

## Authentication and Admin rules

- Email, Google and supported providers are ways to authenticate the same Otya identity.
- Google authentication must not be followed by a demand for the normal Otya password merely because Google was used.
- Admin eligibility is resolved server-side from the authenticated account.
- A normal user must never see or gain Admin capability merely by navigating to an Admin URL.
- An owner/admin may complete required fresh verification on the normal sign-in surface.
- UI visibility is never authorization. Privileged APIs remain server-authorized.
- High-impact operations may require fresh step-up verification even when the owner is already signed in.

## Public documentation scope

Public Docs may cover:

- Getting started and installation
- Video playback and controls
- Music library, queue and playlists
- Transfer send/receive and troubleshooting
- Private media behavior
- Media Tools and supported formats
- Next capabilities, live-search behavior, limitations and privacy
- Account, Google sign-in, recovery and deletion
- Space/backups only when actually available
- Role-aware account behavior at a user-safe level
- Troubleshooting and support

Private engineering documentation belongs in the repository or authenticated internal tools, not on the public Docs hostname.

## Status model

Public components should use user-language, for example:

- OTYA Accounts
- Next
- OTYA Web
- Downloads & Updates
- OTYA Space

Incident lifecycle: Investigating -> Identified -> Monitoring -> Resolved.

Never expose internal service bindings or stack traces.

## Changelog model

Status answers "is it working?". Changelog answers "what changed?".

Release notes should use user outcomes under New / Improved / Fixed. Avoid internal implementation detail unless it materially helps developers or security reviewers.

## Product communication rules

- No fake metrics or unsupported superiority claims.
- No copied competitor wording, layouts or screenshots.
- Research competitors for patterns and user expectations, then design an OTYA-specific solution.
- Public posts describe user outcomes, not Worker/D1/queue maintenance.
- Do not publish empty News/Careers/Developer sections just to look large.
- Do not advertise platforms or capabilities that are not production-ready.
- PeterSmart Link is the developer/publisher brand; OTYA is a product family.

## Design and performance rules

Modernization means hierarchy, motion, responsiveness and consistency, not simply gradients or rounded rectangles.

Every user-facing workflow needs:

- immediate interaction feedback
- meaningful loading/progress state
- useful empty state
- specific error message
- recovery/retry action when possible
- accessibility semantics
- responsive layout
- light/dark compatibility
- consistent typography, spacing, shapes and iconography within each product surface

For Next specifically, sending a prompt must never create a long blank wait. Show immediate thinking/tool state, stream output as soon as possible, expose Stop/Retry, and route simple questions directly instead of invoking expensive retrieval unnecessarily.

## v1 release discipline

No new feature expansion until the v1 blockers pass. Priority is stabilization, modernization and system coherence.

A release remains blocked by any P0 failure in account creation/sign-in, Next response path, update/download path, core media playback, physical Android media-session acceptance, or required production infrastructure.
