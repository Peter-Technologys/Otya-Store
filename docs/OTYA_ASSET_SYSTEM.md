# OTYA System Asset Kit

This document is the single source of truth for OTYA website, app-store, social, APK-release and future marketing assets.

## Non-negotiable OTYA identity

- The canonical symbol is the approved **twisted O** supplied in the OTYA brand pack. Do not redraw it as a plain ring and do not substitute a play triangle.
- The official color flow is **cyan/electric blue → violet/magenta → orange/yellow** on deep navy/black surfaces.
- When the symbol and product name appear on the same line, render **symbol + TYA**, never **symbol + OTYA**. The symbol itself is the O.
- Keep the symbol geometry unchanged across Android launcher/adaptive/themed icons, Flutter UI, website/favicon/PWA, Admin, Developer surfaces, emails, store assets and marketing art.
- Single-color/monochrome variants may change color only; the geometry must remain the same.
- User-facing screenshots and mockups must use the real current OTYA UI. Do not invent a second app interface inside a phone mockup and present it as the shipped product.
