  ['Acceptance', 'By accessing or using Otya websites, accounts, applications or connected services, you agree to these Terms and applicable product-specific policies.'],

  ['Local media', 'You are responsible for media you store, play, organize, transfer or process with Otya and for complying with applicable copyright, privacy and other laws. Otya does not obtain ownership of your local media merely because the app accesses it for a feature you choose.'],
  ['Next', 'Next may generate incorrect or incomplete information. Verify important information independently. Customer-facing Next does not receive access to private administrator systems.'],
  ['Prohibited use', 'Do not use Otya for fraud, abuse, unauthorized access, unlawful distribution, copyright infringement, interference with service operation, malware delivery or attempts to obtain secrets or bypass security controls.'],
  ['Software and updates', 'Features, availability and requirements may change over time. Updates may improve security, compatibility, performance and functionality.'],
  ['Third-party services', 'Optional features may interact with services such as Google, Telegram, Firebase, Resend and Cloudflare. Their terms and privacy practices may apply when you use those integrations.'],
  ['Liability', 'To the extent permitted by applicable law, Otya is not responsible for indirect, incidental or consequential losses resulting from use of the services or from third-party service availability.'],
